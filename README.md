# tweet_comment_sentiment_gauge
A website that breaks down the sentiments of a tweet's comments and reactions, and puts it into scale. 
The website will scrape a tweet's comments, gauge whether each comment is positive, negative, or neutral 
and plot it onto a graph. The website will also display the current number of tweet's likes, reposts, and 
repost with comments. The end goal of this project will incorporate a ML model to determine the positivity 
level of each comment AND retweet(with comment).

The goal: To put a tweet's reaction into perspective instead of just having a blind/blanket 
"like" gauge that could easily be a misinterpreted or rigged.

Why: In this time of polarity, context is everything.

TLDR; Plot out a tweet's comment's reactions breakdown based on "supportive" or "opposed" responses. 
The project will also provide the tweet's analytics and tweet-er's activity.
